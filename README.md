The Backbone of JNTUHRESULTS-WEB where all the semester results of a student and the results of all the classmates are fetched

## HOW IT WORKS

* Jntuh website doesn't have any api and it does not authenticate when a request is made it just sends back the response of that request
* I made a request and i got a response and using beautiful soup i have parse the html and i got my results

## API
* https://jntuhresults.up.railway.app/api/single?htno={Roll_NO}
* https://jntuhresults.up.railway.app/api/multi?from={from_roll_no}&to={To_roll_no}&code={code}
