The Backbone of <a href="https://github.com/ThilakReddyy/JNTUHRESULTS-WEB">JNTUHRESULTS-WEB</a> where all the semester results of a student and the results of all the classmates are fetched

## HOW IT WORKS

* The JNTUH website does not have an API, and it does not authenticate requests. Instead, it sends back the response of each request made
* I made a request and received a response. Using Beautiful Soup, I parsed the HTML and obtained the results.

## API
Two API endpoints are available for fetching results:

* https://jntuhresults.up.railway.app/api/academicresult?htno={Roll_NO} - Fetches results for a single student using their roll number.
* https://jntuhresults.up.railway.app/api/classresult?htnos={multiple_htnos_seperate_by_commas}&semester={code} - Fetches results for multiple students within a given range of roll numbers and code.


## Running Locally

To run the code locally in development mode, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ThilakReddyy/JNTUHRESULTS-SERVICE.git`
* Navigate to the repository: `cd JNTUHRESULTS-SERVICE`
* Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Run the server: `python manage.py runserver`
* Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser to view the results.
