This repository serves as the backbone for the [JNTUH RESULTS](https://github.com/ThilakReddyy/JNTUHRESULTS-WEB)  project. It fetches the semester results of a student and their classmates from the JNTUH website.

## HOW IT WORKS

The JNTUH website does not provide an API and does not require authentication for requests. Instead, it sends back the response for each request made. This service makes requests to the JNTUH website and parses the HTML response using Beautiful Soup to obtain the results.

## API'S

There are two API endpoints available for fetching results:

* `https://jntuhresults.up.railway.app/api/academicresult?htno={Roll_NO}` - Fetches results for a single student using their roll number.
* `https://jntuhresults.up.railway.app/api/classresult?htnos={multiple_htnos_separate_by_commas}&semester={code}` - Fetches results for multiple students within a given range of roll numbers and code.
## Running Locally

To run the code locally in development mode, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ThilakReddyy/JNTUHRESULTS-SERVICE.git`
* Navigate to the repository: `cd JNTUHRESULTS-SERVICE`
* Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Run the server: `python manage.py runserver`
* Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser to view the results.
